In order to create a vertical view of the table, we used 5 select queries which selected the information needed to create the view (CountryName, year, indicator, data) for each of the GM tables (POP, LE, EL, GDP, HS). The 5 select queries are each joined by a union in order to create the entire vertical view with all the GM tables together. Therefore, the gmv table has the country name along with the year and indicator and data that corresponds to its respective data from the original GM table.

Using RStudio to create the graphs.
Typed in install.package(googleVis) in order to use the Motion Chart (like GapMinder graphs)
We have our own .csv file exported from the mondial database, then later imported
on the R's dataset.

The code is R is:
data name is gmh.
9D_a
library(googleVis)
df = unique(gmh)
df$value=rnorm(nrow(df))
M <- gvisMotionChart(df, idvar = "Country", timevar="Year", xvar = "Year",yvar = "LE")
plot.gvis(M)

9D_b
library(googleVis)
df = unique(gmh)
df$value=rnorm(nrow(df))
M <- gvisMotionChart(df, idvar = "Country", timevar="Year", xvar = "HS", yvar ="LE")
plot.gvis(M)



Due to the issue that I'm not able to resolve in knit, I provide 2 ways to see the graph.
First is actually following the steps to recreate the R program.
Method 1 is strongly recommended.
Method 1:
1. Load the environment.RData into RStudio. Iâ€™ve attached a jpg picture to show where to click on. (How_to_load_environment.jpg).
2. Download the googleVis by typing "install.packages('googleVis') at the console.
2. OpenD9A.Rmd on RStudio for 9D_a and run the chunk.
3. Afterwards, it should show the table in a new window.
4. Repeat the step 2 and 3 but for code 9D_b


Method 2:
1. Please open D9a.html on a text editor, and let it sits for 3 mins because there are are huge amount of code to load.

NOTE: PLEASE OPEN THE FILE ON NOTEPAD, OTHERWISE THE BROWSER WILL FREEZE.
(Any text editor will be fine.)

2. Please do control + A to select all the code and Copy them into 
a website that I found which allow the HTML 
http://www.draac.com/javatester.html

Paste the code in the box. 
It takes another 1~3 minutes depending on the computer.

3. Once it's done pasting, click on Test.
4. It takes about 20 seconds to load the code, but it should work.  I tested on 3 computers.


Final Notes:

The HTML files are the graphs.
Each HTML has 3 types of graph: the bubble one, line, and a different line charts.

The bubble chart doesn't show the data for all the year because i small.
For more accurate date, click on the second or third representation of the graph.

If anything goes wrong or you guys can't show it, please contact me through text.
My number is 916-698-2098.
I will show you in person.

The D9A_Result.jpg and D9B_Result.jpg are the results after running R.


gmh.csv is just the data that we created in order to complete the task for D9.

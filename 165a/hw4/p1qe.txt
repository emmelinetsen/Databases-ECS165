The output that I obtain is that both of the tables (country and language) don't have any tuples left after the delete because table Country references table Language and vise versa. Therefore, when I delete a tuple from Country, it would delete what it referenced in Language and that would delete another tuple from Country which eventually deletes all the tuples in both tables.

'on delete cascade' would be used when we delete table A, table B would be deleted as well. Therefore, assume we have two tables for production, a table for car brand name and another table for car models. We would want to use delete cascade because if we delete the car brand, the model names should be deleted as well since there is no brand to produce the car model. On the other hand, assume we have a table Major (College major) and a table Student. We would not want to use delete cascade because deleting the major (possibly due to lack of funding) would not mean that we would want to delete the Student table because the students still exist.

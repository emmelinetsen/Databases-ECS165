Type of project implemented: GDT-PSV

--INPUTS USED
Used the mondial.sql file from ECS165A except we removed the ALTER TABLE and CREATE VIEW
from the schema. The .sql file used is attached. The primary key parsing works if the 
spacing is consistent within the file. 

The following is an example of bad spacing where the result will be one attribute labeled "Country1,Country2"
CONSTRAINT BorderKey PRIMARY KEY (Country1,Country2) );
The following is an example of good spacing where the result will (correctly) be two attributes labeled "Country1" and "Country2" respectively.
CONSTRAINT BorderKey PRIMARY KEY (Country1 , Country2) );
Otherwise, our parser can handle the vast majority of other spacing issues.

Nevertheless, the program should be able to parse
any schema effectively and creates a good graphic visualization.

--HOW TO BUILD THE SYSTEM FROM THE SOURCES
Included are three Java classes, where main is located within the file name parser.java
The other two classes, FKEdge.java and Node.java, are helper classes that parser.java
depend on. To run the progrom, run parser.java and make sure that the three classes
are within the same directory. The source file in which we ran our tests on, mondial.sql,
is also included where the ALTER TABLEs and CREATE VIEWs are removed. parser.java takes
in mondial.sql to run and outputs myGraph.dot. NOTE: we used Eclipse which has a nice tool called Zest that graphically displays the .dot file
before we use GraphViz to create a graphical .pdf of the result.

--SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES ON OTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGES
None. You can run the java program and it will create a .dot file for you for which you can use GraphViz to display the representation. Eclipse's Zest
tool automatically generated the visual graph for us.

--HOW TO RUN THE TOOL
If you are using Eclipse, download Zest and click on the "Export ?dot file to pdf" button. Zest will prompt you to locate the directory with GraphViz's dot executable.
Once that is located clicking the button will generate the .pdf seamlessly. Obviously, you can still generate the .pdf image from the .dot file using GraphViz outside
of Eclipse, it's just that we found Eclipse's Zest tool very handy.

--DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Eclipse with the Zest plugin.
